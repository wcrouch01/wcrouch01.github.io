					<p> Indian born, Dubai raised, British taught, American schooled… I am a multi-cultured and world travelled <b>computer science major</b> currently in my <b>senior year</b> at <b>UCLA</b>.<br>
					In my journey through the road of 1’s and 0’s I have found that the true power of a computer scientist lies in the ability to shape reality and transform the future all while sitting behind the screen of a 13-inch computer. 
					I have learnt that it is not only the movement of one’s fingers across a sleek keyboard, transcribing code like a conductor directs a musical masterpiece, 
					but also the ability to convey my ideas and share my experiences and learnings that allows me to help shape the lives around me for the better.<br>
					I am constantly curious about the ever changing world of software engineering, having first found love as an avid <b>iOS developer</b>. After about a year in the space, I decided to switch my specialty to being a <b>Backend Engineer</b> for both web applications and for the lowest levels of <b>infrastructure</b>. My current interests include <b>distributed systems</b> and <b>blockchain technology</b>.
					I hope to use the various skills and experiences I've picked up over the past couple of years to serve the overall community in a positive way.
					I love working with companies to elevate their products and ambitions, having worked as a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Autodesk</a> and <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank">Uber</a>. I will be pursuing a <b>Full time Software Engineering</b> position at <b>Uber</b> starting <em>Fall 2018</em>.
					But my passion doesn’t stop at the intricacies of computer science, they continue to flow into the field of art through the form of <b>graphic design and illustration</b>. 
					Working through <b>Sketch</b> I use my intuition and gut feeling to design the best possible UI/UX that goes into my apps, and follow through by creating 
					the graphics that truly resonate with who I am. <br>
					These are my passions, but what are passions if we don’t try and share them with the world… Throughout my schooling journey and beyond, I have always chosen 
					to <b>teach what I have learnt</b> as best as I could to those willing to learn. As the former <b>tutoring chair</b> for both <b>Tau Beta Pi</b> and 
					<b>Upsilon Pi Epsilon</b> at UCLA, I helped those struggling in engineering and computer science find the same love and passion as I have for the field.<br>
					I am taking my teaching ability to new heights by being a <b>Learning Assistant</b> for <b>CS 32</b> this quarter at UCLA.
					In addition to my teaching endeavours, I love to apply my knowledge into practicalities through various projects and organizations. I am currently growing my leadership and management skills as the <b>President</b> of <a href="http://ucladevx.com/#/" target="_blank">DevX</a>, <b>Co-director</b> of <a href="https://lahacks.com/" target="_blank">LA Hacks</a> and as an ex Product Manager for an iOS project at <a href="http://www.uclacreatives.com" target="_blank">Creative Labs</a>.<br>
					Last but not least, I hope to carry forth all that I have learnt as both a developer, designer and product manager to eventually drive the entrepreneur within me. As such I am one of the <b>founders</b> and <b>CTO</b> of <a href="http://www.pomily.com/" target="_blank">Pomily</a>, one of the <b>Entrepreneurship Chairs</b> for UPE, leading initiatives such as <a href="http://uclafs.com/#/" target="_blank">Founder's School</a>.<br>
					If you have reached the end of this brief description of me as a person, then I assume you are interested in working with me or meeting me. If so feel 
					free to explore <a id="goto" href="#work" onclick="changeContent(event)">my work</a> and <a href="./resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>,

							<p> The past four years of programming have taken me through a whirlwind of several programming languages, helping me hone my skills as a low-level systems programmer for AutoCAD at <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Autodesk</a>, an iOS developer on several side projects, a backend web developer for my <a href="http://www.pomily.com" target="_blank">startup, Pomily</a> and various projects such as <a href="http://grade-portal.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">GradePortal</a>. Taking my passion for working behind the scenes I fell in love with infrastructure as an intern on the Mobile Developer Platform team at <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank">Uber</a>. I will be joining Uber full time this year, hoping to take my skills to new heights in the field of infrastructure and distributed systems.

									Worked on two projects for improving the developer experience for mobile engineers at Uber, while also optimizing existing services. The first project revolved around creating a Go service to provide remote device connection for application testing of the mobile applications. Utilizing third party services to provide remote device connection, the device labs project provides an API and device agnostic wrapper to various functionality with devices including connection and disconnection. It was usable through a friendly commandline interface, with logging and metrics collection. <br> The second project build an event pipeline for differential builds from Phabricator and Jenkins. It provided strong metrics and a notification system capable of failure commenting.

									I am currently on the board for Creative Labs as the iOS Project Lead. In summary, Creative Labs serves as the bridge between designers and developers at
									UCLA to bring the two disciplines together to build amazing quarter long projects, and give anyone and everyone the opportunity to learn the skills to become either a
									developer or designer through our weekly workshops and speaker series.<br>
									As the iOS Project Lead, I have worked with leading a beginners iOS workshop in the Fall of 2016, where I helped 7 students understand the fundamentals of
									Swift and iOS development through a simple Todo application. This Winter, I intend on leading an advanced iOS project by recruiting about developers and 
									designers to work on a iOS project from the ground up to release on the App Store.<br>

									<b>Creation:</b> SD Hacks, October 2015 <br>
									<b>Awards:</b> Best Use of IBM Bluemix [IBM at SDHacks], Most Entrepreneurially Viable Hack [Perkins Coie at SDHacks], Hack That Best Connects Us [ViaSat at SDHacks],
									Most Innovative Award [Facebook at ACM Hacker Expo 2015], Individuals Impacted [IBM at Bluemixathon]<br>
									<b>Details:</b><br>
									Future without borders was conceived and created around the peak of the <a href="https://www.mercycorps.org/articles/iraq-jordan-lebanon-syria-turkey/quick-facts-what-you-need-know-about-syria-crisis" target="_blank">Syrian Refugee Crisis</a>
									in order to try and provide help to the fleeing refugees that entered these new countries, hopeful to start a new life.<br>
									Following a pattern similar to that of AirBnb, we decided to build out an iOS application that would be ideally used by the citizens of the countries accepting refugees at the time, to allow these "hosts"
									to see any nearby refugee family that might be in need of assistance. The app would allow the host to provide aid to the family selected by picking them up from the nearby locaiton and hosting them for a few days
									to help them start their new lives.<br>
									On the refugee side, we assumed the access to a smartphone would be limited, and so we used <a href="https://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank">Twilio</a>'s API to provide a unique number that the refugees could
									text to register them as requiring assistance. Based on cellular location we would provide said location to the iOS application.<br>
									This project won three sponsored awards at SD Hacks and continued to win two more awards from IBM and Facebook. Unfortunately, due to several 
									unfortunate circumstances, the project fell on the back burner and to this day remains a MVP. More information can be found on the project's

									<b>Creation:</b> HackSC, November 2015 <br>
									<b>Awards:</b> Best Mobile Hack<br>
									<b>Details:</b><br>
									The weekend of HackSC was also the weekend of the horrible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks" target="_blank">Paris Attacks</a>. Noticing, the
									lack of an efficient method to warn people, family, friends and law enforcement, we decided to create an easy, single tap solution. From that came Lighthouse, a single
									tap SOS button located on your home screen. The version built at HackSC used Parse as the backend and was able to notify family members and friends listed in the app of 
									your danger.<br>
									After seeing the usefulness of this application, we continued to build it out over a few months, making the application more robust and marketable. We created our backend in Ruby on Rails,
									hosted on Heroku. The iOS application evolved to have its own networking interface, included requested tracking, pulled daily updated crime events in the area, and acted as a miniature 
									social media application, aimed at bringing together people for the purpose of safety and crowd-sourced danger reports.<br>
									After noticing that we couldn't find a decent monetization strategy, the application was abandoned. More information about the application can be found on the 
									<a href="http://devpost.com/software/lighthouse-9wigoq" target="_blank">Devpost</a> and on the <a href="http://www.lighthouseapp.io/" target="_blank">landing page</a>.

									<b>Details:</b><br>
									After reading a paper on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576" target="_blank">Convolutional Neural Networks and Art</a> we decided to create a mobile application that would make use of the <a href="https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style" target="_blank">torch implementation</a>
									to allow everyday users to get a feel for the true power of Artificial Intelligence in their hands.<br>
									After running some tests, we found that on a computer such as a Macbook Pro Retina 13" the image rendering took several minutes to a couple of hours, we decided to move the computation to Amazon EC2 servers with more powerful graphics cards.
									The iOS application was written to take in two images either through your camera roll or through an image address and would send the images to the server managed by node.js, where a BASH script would take the combined image and send it back to the iOS application which would
									display the results. The app ran well within 5 minutes per image, and was one of the very first versions of mobile CNN's. It placed third overall at LA Hacks.<br>
									The application was slated to be worked on during Summer of 2016, to create scheduling mechanisms for server loading, but another app beat us to market. More information about the application can be found 
									at the <a href="http://devpost.com/software/stitch" target="_blank">Devpost</a>.

									<b>Details:</b><br>
									As the final project and submission to CSM152A, my teammate and I built Doodle Fall. This game is a simple one, where the objective of you, the tiny green doodle,
									is to stay alive as long as possible, by falling downards along the blocks that appear, avoiding hittint the top and bottom of the screen. The score was determined as a function
									of time. Similarly, the difficulty of the game was also a function of time, wherein the speed of the falling would increase as you lasted longer in the game. The green blocks were
									powerups that would slow down the speed of falling.<br>
									This game was made entirely in Verilog, using an FPGA, Joystick, VGA, Seven Segment LED Display and buttons. The game would store the highest score, and would allow you to reset the game.
									The joystick allowed you to move horizontally with the speed of movement as a function of the movement of the joystick. The VGA took our code and created a simplistic view on any computer
									monitor. The video above demonstrates the key features of the game.

									built a small application that leveraged Firebase as our backend.<br>
									Using Facebook's iOS SDK for login and user authentication and Firebase for data storage and retrieval, we built out an application wherein you, the user can go about
									your daily life, and if you find anything intersting in the location you're currently at, you can leave either a message about the situation or the place within that location
									on a global map. Any other user of the app can find that message/photo and view it.<br>
									The aim of the application was to allow users to share their experiences in a more intimate manner.

									<b>Languages:</b> C#, Python<br>
									<b>Creation:</b> CalHacks 2.0, October 2015 <br>
									<b>Awards:</b> Top Five at CalHacks 2.0 <br>
									<b>Details:</b><br>
									In an attempt to work with hardware, my teammates and I took it upon ourselves to make neurology a more immersive experience. The result was BrainSpace VR,
									wherein you dawn an Oculus Rift headset to find yourself viewing the 3-D model of a human brain. Equipped with the accompanying Myo Armband, you as the user are
									able to click on different parts of the brain to learn more about it, and are able to rotate and zoom into the brain to experience it like never before.<br>
									<a href="http://omarozgur.com" target="_blank">Omar Ozgur</a> was primarily involved with writing some of the C# code to work with the Oculus, while I was involved
									with using Python and the BeauitfulSoup Library to scrape various webpages to find the different informaiton about the different parts of the brain. Together we worked to
									additionally include the Muse Headband, to allow simultaneous viewing of your own brain wave pattern. More about the product can be found on our <a href="http://devpost.com/software/brain-space-vr" target="_blank">Devpost</a>.

									<p> <b>Platform:</b> CryEngine<br>
									<b>Languages:</b> C++, Lua, Cryengine Flowgraphing<br>
									<b>Creation:</b> CS188 - UCLA, June 2016 <br>
									<b>Details:</b><br>
									Using <a href="https://www.cryengine.com/" target="_blank">CryEngine</a> my teammates and I created an MVP game with Artificial Intelligence mechanisms. The premise of the
									game was that the player was a man sent back through time to steal the very first iPhone model in order to throw themselves into fame and fortune. The game was built with only a single level to demonstrate its
									potential. The player is thrown into an environment where they are expected to get through the level either by alerting no guards, or by taking out all the guards in their way to get to the final destination. The score
									is determined by the speed and efficacy with which the player reached the goal.<br>
									We programmed the guards to have varying levels of AI using CryEngine's in-built AI mechanisms with slight tweaks of our own, such as giving the guards a proximity sensor based on noise, visibility and distance of the player 
									to the guard. So the guard would move from standby, to suspicious to alerted mode. The player would be able to hide in a group of employees to detract attention.<br>
									The game had the ability to be AI controlled based on player performance metrics. Using a weighted function based on the time, targets killed and other factors, we programmed the AI to complete the level achieving the best 
									score possible. Thus the game would be able to switch from user mode, to AI mode. The video above describes in great detail each of our contributions and the results.

									<b>Details:</b><br>
									Worked to implement an effective and platform independent serialization mechanism, leveraging JSON, to create an Inter Process Communication channel. 
									This project was built as a workable unit test integrated into AutoCAD with code written to be readily extensible. The serialization involved taking low 
									level calls and packaging them into a custom built messaging schema. Throughout the internship I gained experience in discussing progress 
									and workarounds with professional senior software engineers and software architects. I learnt how to navigate a huge code base consisting of million lines of code
									, while learning the conventions for building industrial strength projects. This greatly improved my ability to modularize and componentize projects.

							<p> Using <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> as my weapon of choice, I have worked with designing simple vector illustrations to various interfaces focused on providing the most seamless user experiences. In almost all of my projects I have primarily been a mix of developer and designer. I hope to continuosly expand this skillset and welcome any and all <a href="mailto:jcherian@g.ucla.eduu?Subject=Design" target="_top">feedback</a>. Below are some of my illustrations from two summers ago!

									</div>
									<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 description">
										<p>The Boat in the bottle was my very first illustration 
										and really pushed me into the space of illustration. Unique to my later designs, it focuses
										more on gradients and less on flat design. I really wanted to encapsulate a new feeling to the
										idea of designing a boat, wherein the design could remain simple but be unique to just the generic boat in a sea.</p>

									</div>
									<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 description">
										<p> Continuing from my design of the boat I felt like the style of using gradients was really working.
										This inspired me to create a small token of rememberance to a great fighter and a great man in general. <a href="http://muhammadali.com/" target="_blank">Muhammad Ali</a>.
										This piece really challenged me to using the vector tool more than ever before. The aesthetic is not as pleasing
										as the other designs, but stands out to me because it was the tipping point for me to focus on simpler designs, rather
										than approach a complex piece from a simplistic style.</p>

										<p> Wanting to try my newfound skills to more natural landscapes, I went to Google to find the most compelling
										landscape I could find, and settled on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denali_National_Park_and_Preserve" target="_blank">Denali National Park</a> in Alaska.
										Instead of detailing the landscape, I wanted to try to go for a more simplistic approach, and focused on the beautiful colours of the mountains
										from all the pictures I could find. As you can see, though there is still a presence of a gradient based design, this piece showcases a focus on
										a limited colour palette in an attempt to move to a more flat look.</p>

										<p> Continuing in my sudden surge of inspiration for nature and its beauty, I decided to undertake creating a campfire. This is
										my first piece where I truly transition to a flat design, going for simplistic focuses on the fire itself and the background of a large
										yet beautiful moon. To this date, I continue to believe that this was one of my best pieces as it truly showcases how a simple design
										can remain beautiful and compelling.</p>

										<p> After a sparse design with the desk, I decided to focus on a smaller object. Playing cards have always been portrayed as having the ability to be aethetically 
										designed, so I sought out to try and create my own imitation of the King of Spades. The thought pattern for the design of the king's face came from several iterations
										of a cartoon like portrayal of kings, noticing the hefty beards and majestic crowns. Using this backbone of information, I created the result you see now. This design
										remains to this date one of my favourite designs due to its simplicity and uniqueness.</p>

										<p> In this design I tried to create a character of sorts. Looking into my own definition of cute characters, I learnt that big eyes and rounded mouths was the way to go. And so 
										Jeffrey was born. He's by no means a complex design, nor is he necessarily colourful, but to me he captures the essence of innocence and delicacy that comes to my imagination.
										I found that placing him within a simple thunderstorm environment would be able to express the very emotions described above.</p>

										<p> Watching the news and atrocities of all the countries that had suffered so many casualties over the summer, I decided to show my support by creating a very simple
										design that tried to emphasis the unity of the world behind these countries, and all other countries that had faced so much terror in the wake of the modern century. To this day,
										I hope that this design can inspire people to accept one another, and unite against common evil.</p>
